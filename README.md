# Cafeteria Prepay Wallet (Move on Aptos)

## 📖 Description
The **Cafeteria Prepay Wallet** is a simple Move smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain.  
It allows students to **preload funds** into a campus wallet, set a **spending limit**, and make cafeteria payments with **discounts or subsidies applied automatically**.  

The contract ensures:
- Students can only spend within their set limits.  
- Discounts/subsidies reduce the final payable amount.  
- Parents/guardians can configure safe spending limits.  

This system is ideal for **campus cafeterias, prepaid services, and parental monitoring of student expenses**.

## 🌍 Vision
Our vision is to **digitize campus transactions** by providing a **secure, transparent, and controlled prepaid wallet system**.  
With enforced spend limits and discount/subsidy support, the wallet empowers both students and parents, ensuring financial discipline while enabling smooth cafeteria experiences.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Parental View Access**: Allow parents to check student wallet balance and spending history.  
- **Top-up Notifications**: Alerts when balance falls below a threshold.  
- **Daily/Monthly Spend Limits**: Extend beyond per-transaction limits.  
- **Multi-merchant Support**: Expand beyond cafeteria to bookstores, libraries, or transport.  
- **Mobile Integration**: Seamless integration with campus apps for instant payments.
